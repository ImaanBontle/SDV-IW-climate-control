# Climate Control

This mod allows you to influence the weather throughout the year by customising the probabilities of each type of weather found in the game (rain, thunderstorms, snow, wind, sun), depending on the current season and the time of year. This mod is part of a larger framework called ImmersiveWeathers (IW), which aims to create immersive weather and climate experiences for players of Stardew Valley. Climate Control (CC) is the first mod in this framework and there are plans to expand this framework to a family of sister mods which will  influence the weather/environment/ambience of the game in other ways.

NB: Right now, Climate Control is in very early (but active!) development. Currently, I am working on a rudimentary control of the weather probabilities before implementing more detailed features. Please be patient as I gradually flesh out the mod.

## Feature plans

In the future, I am planning to add multiple different templates you can select from. Each template will simulate a biome normally found on Earth (or at least, those that would make sense within the Valley!) and the different proportions of rain, snow, wind, thunderstorms found throughout the year. The richness of these templates will grow as features are added to this mod and as sister IW mods are integrated. The player can also adjust these values manually if they so desire, although the templates will provide a pre-built, hand-customised configuration from which to start.

Over time, Climate Control's' weather system will also be expanded so as to become more complex, allowing for gradually-varying probabilities each day/week (to simulate the gradual passing of the seasons). For example, this might mean having more rainfall at the start of Summer, before it tapers off as Fall approaches. Or as Winter approaches, you might experience a higher likelihood of snow. Not only would this be customised for each biome, but the player will also be able to customise the behaviour of this variation (although, I haven't yet figured out how to make it completely intuitive!).

Ideally, this would make the climates feel more realistic and immersive and less 'modular'. Especially when combined with later features like including random fluctuations (stochasticity) in the weather probabilities or slightly (!) inaccurate weather forecasts.

## Support for other mods

I am not currently planning any integrations with Weathers of Ferngill.

While I am aware of this mod and it was part of what inspired me to make this, unfortunately, that mod hasn't been fully updated for a while. It is also currently sitting in a very incomplete state with most of its features not implemented. This makes it very difficult to support long-term with IW, so it is highly unlikely an integration will ever occur. That said, should Weathers of Ferngill ever start receiving regular updates again, I may reconsider this.

Who knows, maybe IW will even implement similar features someday! It really depends on whether I have enough good ideas to justify this. One step at a time...
