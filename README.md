# Climate Control

This mod allows you to influence the weather throughout the year by customising the probabilities of each type of weather found in the game (rain, thunderstorms, snow, wind, sun), depending on the current season and the time of year.

This mod is part of a larger framework called ImmersiveWeathers (IW), which aims to create immersive experiences for players in Stardew Valley. Climate Control (CC) is the first mod in this framework and there are plans to expand this framework to a set of sister mods which each influence the weather/environment/ambience in different ways.

*NB: Right now, Climate Control is in very early (but active!) development. Currently, I am working on a rudimentary control of the weather probabilities before implementing more detailed features. Please be patient as I gradually flesh out the mod.*

## Feature plans

In the future, I am planning to add multiple different templates you can choose from. Each template will simulate a biome normally found on Earth (or at least, those that would make sense within the Valley!) and the different proportions of rain, snow, wind, thunderstorms found throughout the year. The richness of these templates will grow as features are added to this mod and as sister mods are integrated. The player can adjust these values manually if they so desire, but the templates provide a pre-built, hand-customised configuration which you can use as a starting point..

Over time, Climate Control's' weather system will also be expanded to become more complex, allowing for gradually-varying probabilities each day/week (to simulate the gradual passing of the seasons). For example, this might mean having more rainfall at the start of Summer, before it tapers off as Fall approaches. Or as Winter approaches, you might experience a higher likelihood of snow. Not only would this be customised for each biome, but the player will also be able to customise the behaviour of this variation (although, I haven't yet figured out how to make it completely intuitive!).

Ideally, this would make the climates feel more realistic and immersive and less 'modular' than they do right now. Especially when this is combined with planned features like random fluctuations (stochasticity) in the weather probabilities or slightly (!) inaccurate weather forecasts.

## Support for other mods

Unfortunately, I am not currently planning any integrations with Weathers of Ferngill.

While I am aware of the mod and it was part of my inspiration for making this mod, Weathers of Ferngill hasn't been properly updated in quite a while. It is also currently sitting in a very incomplete state. This makes it very difficult to provide long-term support while I add and expand on IW features, so it is highly unlikely an integration will ever occur. But who knows, maybe IW will one day implement similar features? It really depends on whether I have enough good ideas to justify doing this.

That said, if Weathers of Ferngill did start receiving regular updates again, I may reconsider my stance...

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. One step at a time.
