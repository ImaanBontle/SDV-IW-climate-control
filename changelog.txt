v0.3.1:
-----
- Stopped mod from caching model every day. Now checks model choice on save loaded.

v0.3.0:
-----
- Added integration with Framework. Now broadcasts weather changes to SMAPI console through the Framework.
- Created a class framework for storing multiple different template models and printing these to json files at first launch. Major code re-write to accomodate this.
- If player edits a template's json files, mod will use the edited values.
- Player can also create a custom template by editing config.json and also specifying a "custom" model.
- Subcategorised seasonal weather into "Mid" grouping, in anticipation of "Early", "Mid" and "Late" chances of each weather type.
- Fleshed out code comments.
- Added list of models to API.
- Made sure mod only caches Framework's API once rather than daily.
- Mod only checks for model choice the first time.
- Integrated TODO into code, rather than separate file

v0.2.1:
-----
- Minor code clean-up.

v0.2.0:
-----
- Added config file for each weather type's chance per season.
- Implemented a dice roll for changing the weather tomorrow (first weather feature implemented!).

v0.1.0:
-----
- Initial release for purposes of generating GitHub keys. Demonstrates rudimentary fixing of weather to a certain day of the week.
